Welcome to our collection of bees - Breadboard Expansions by [EMT](https://github.com/emtpb) ("Elektrische Messtechnik", Measurement Engineering Group at Paderborn University).
Bees are small printed circuit boards and part of our "modular, scalable open-hardware platform for laboratory courses in electrical engineering studies" as presented at SEFI 2020 [1].
They are actively used in our laboratory course and workshops for pupils.

Besides the actual bees ([repos named bee-*](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Abeecourse+bee)), this organisation contains everything you need to design your own bees ([repos named kicad-*](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Abeecourse+kicad-)).
